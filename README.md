Hello, this is my very first project in C++. I'm a beginner in this field and I'm attempting to create a "Tic-Tac-Toe" game, aiming to apply the maximum of my acquired knowledge through this project.

I'm aware that there are probably plenty of mistakes and some awkward moments - I embrace them and live with them :D
